### 👋 About Me

I am an AI and autonomy enthusiast with a strong foundation in Computer Engineering and hands-on experience in Android Development. My passion lies at the intersection of creating intelligent, human-centric systems and tackling ambitious, real-world challenges.

I am the founder of **Aixino**, a research-driven initiative aimed at exploring the frontiers of safe and beneficial Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). While my long-term vision includes ambitious goals in aerospace and human-machine symbiosis, my current focus is on building a solid foundation through practical projects and advanced education.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a **Real-Time Persian Sign Language Detection** system using TensorFlow 2.
- 🌱 I’m constantly learning about **advanced machine learning architectures, MLOps, and scalable system design.**
- 💬 Ask me about **Android Development (Kotlin & Jetpack Compose), Object Detection, or my vision for Aixino.**
- 🎯 My Goal: To pursue graduate studies in the United States, contributing to research that pushes the boundaries of applied AI.
